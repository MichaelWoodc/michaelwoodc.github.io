        In this hands-on project, we'll dive into the dynamic landscape of information technology, where advancements and changes can occur very quickly. In our project, we will utilize VMware Workstation, a versatile and robust virtualization platform. Our project involves installing and configuring three different operating systems: Windows 10, Windows Server 2019, and Ubuntu 22.04.
        <br><br>
        While the initial set of instructions has been created to ensure a smooth deployment of web servers, the installation and configuration of specific roles on the server, and applications on the desktop operating systems, keep in mind that the field of IT is ever-evolving. As time progresses, troubleshooting may become necessary, as processes may evolve.
        <br><br>
        Stay prepared for an engaging journey into the world of virtualization and system integration! Let's navigate through the intricacies of tying together these operating systems while creating a robust and interconnected environment in VMware WORKSTATION PRO 17. Embrace the evolving nature of IT as we explore, learn, and adapt together!
