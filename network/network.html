        For this project, we will be creating virtual machines with virtualized network environments that mimic
        physical computers and networks.  
        
        we will need to know some general networking info:
        <ol>
            <li>Loopback adress</li>
            <li>Intranet & its navigation</li>
            <li>Ports</li>
            <li>Firewal Configuration</li>
            <li>DHCP configuration</li>
            <li>DNS</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h2>Localhost</h2>
    <p>
        To develop on our personal PC, we use the loopback address / localhost: The loopback address, commonly represented as 127.0.0.1, is a special IP address that allows a device to communicate with itself. The term "localhost" is often used as a hostname that points to the loopback address. When setting up VMs on a personal computer, developers might use the loopback address or localhost to test applications or services within the same machine without the need for external network communication. This is useful for development and debugging purposes.  One can navigate to localhost in their browser using the name "localhost" or the IP address 127.0.0.1
    </p>
    <h2>Intranet IP address</h2>
    <p>
        When devices are on the same local network and share the same network prefix (subnet), they are said to be on the same subnet.  When configuring your virtual network in VMWare, you may see that it has a different prefix than your host, and will be something like "192.168.xxx.x" in comparison to your host.  Within your VM network, you can access other machines using their IP address.
