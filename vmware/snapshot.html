Snapshots are backups of our VM at any given point in time.  Snapshots (and backups)  play a pivotal role in the success of large projects, providing a safety net and facilitating seamless progress.  Snapshots effectively mitigate risk by acting as a safety net by capturing the exact state of the virtual machine at a specific point in time. This allows for experimentation and exploration without the fear of irreversible consequences.

  Performing incremental changes becomes a breeze with snapshots. You can confidently implement modifications, test configurations, and apply updates incrementally, ensuring that each step contributes positively to the overall project.
  If it doesn't,  you can simply revert back to a prior state.

  <strong>Take snapshots regularly by going to the following in the VMware ribbon menu: VM > Snapshot > Take Snapshot</strong>
