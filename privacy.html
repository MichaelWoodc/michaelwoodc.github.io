        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p>Your privacy is important to us. This policy outlines the limited circumstances under which we collect data, your rights regarding that data, and how we protect it.</p>

        <h2>1. No Logging by Default</h2>
        <p>Under normal circumstances, our website does not log any personal or 
            identifiable information about you. We do not collect, 
            store, or transmit data unless it is explicitly requested as part 
            of your interaction or participation.  Cyber Attacks, Hacking attempts,
            and other forms of unauthorized access are actively monitored against,
            and any such attempts may result in automatic logging of the associated
            IP addresses.  
        </p>

        <h2>2. Explicit Data Collection</h2>
        <p>If you choose to participate in specific activities, such as submitting forms or using interactive features—you may be asked to provide certain information. In these cases, the data collected will be clearly explained, and participation is entirely voluntary.</p>

        <h2>3. Right to Deletion</h2>
        <p>You have the right to request deletion of any data you have provided. However, since we strive to anonymize data at the time of collection, it may be technically impossible to identify and remove specific contributions. If we can reasonably associate data with your request, we will honor the deletion.</p>

        <h2>4. Webcam and Eye Tracking Data</h2>
        <p>For any features involving webcam access or eye tracking (e.g., using WebGazer), no video or related data is stored on our servers or transmitted over the network. All processing is performed locally in your browser. Your video remains private and never leaves your device, only gaze data may be collected.</p>

        <h2>5. Security Measures</h2>
        <p>We regularly perform vulnerability scans and maintain up-to-date security practices to protect against unauthorized access or data exposure. This helps ensure that no one else can access your data or violate your privacy.</p>

        <h2>6. Summary</h2>
        <p>We do not collect anything unless explicitly stated. We don't store what we don't need. And when we do need data, we protect it. That's our promise.</p>

        <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this policy or your data, please feel free to contact us.</p>
